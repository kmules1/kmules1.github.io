The Greater Imperium is the sociocultural region of the Ecumene that encompasses the extent of states and peoples that are descendants of or heavily influenced by the High Imperium and the culture, norms, and traditions of the Edramori people. Its position near the suborbital point of [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-the-great-mother), dominance of the Encircled Sea, and its extensive access to the Sea of Tyrsan, the Northern Ocean, and the Sea of Dayan has enabled the expansion of Edramori culture as well as its export outward to much of the remainder of the Ecumene.

The Greater Imperium is situated primarily on the continents of Thrasu and Acaman, with the region's frontiers reaching westward onto Agelae and eastwards into the islands that ring the Sea of Dayan.

## Philosophy & Religion

**[Ima](/ecumene/beliefs/#Ima)** is the majority belief system within the Greater Imperium, having developed from an imported cult originating among the Sweyriet and a local philosophical trend within the Imperium towards monotheism. In spite of this, prior folk practices persist, either having absorbed some aspects of Ima or having reformulated themselves in opposition to it.
