The Greater Imperium is the sociocultural region of the Ecumene that encompasses the extent of states and peoples that are descendants of or heavily influenced by the High Imperium and the culture, norms, and traditions of the Edramori people. Its position near the suborbital point of [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-the-great-mother), dominance of the Encircled Sea, and its extensive access to the Sea of Tyrsan, the Northern Ocean, and the Sea of Dayan has enabled the expansion of Edramori culture as well as its export outward to much of the remainder of the Ecumene.

The Greater Imperium is situated primarily on the continents of Thrasu and Acaman, with the region's frontiers reaching westward onto Agelae and eastwards into the islands that ring the Sea of Dayan.

## Philosophy & Religion

**'Ima** is the majority belief system within the Greater Imperium.

Its roots are found southeast of the Encircled Sea, among the Sweyriet; it began to enter mainstream society once the Sweyriet began to be recruited as auxiliaries into the army. Their religious practices, called *'Ima* ("Veneration") or *'Ima tal-Iva* ("Veneration of the Iva"), influenced and was influenced by the religious and philosophical milieu of the Imperium to produce the form it has taken in its present day. With the Autocrators as a consistent benefactor since the late High Imperium, 'Ima has become well-integrated into the social fabric all across the Greater Imperium.

In spite of this, folk practices persist, either having absorbed some aspects of 'Ima or having reformulated themselves in opposition to it.
