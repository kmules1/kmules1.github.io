The Ecumene is a habitable world, second in orbit around its star, and the primary world of this setting.

Its surface is predominantly ocean, which takes up eight-ninths of its surface area. Additionally, due the distribution of land, largescale arid and semi-arid biomes are relatively rare. As a result, from space, it looks like a blue marble enveloped by wispy white clouds.

The Ecumene is in a tidally-locked orbit with its twin world, [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-the-great-mother), which is two-thirds the radius and two-fifths the mass. As a result, both worlds have an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. Three moons, the Three Sisters, orbit the Ecumene-Luhan barycenter, which is located one-sixth of the distance between them.

## Geography

Ten major continents, eight minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## Thinking Kinds

The Ecumene is home to several sapient species. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. Other indigenous Thinking Kinds include Halflings and Goblins.

Due to its deep history, it has long become home for additional species that originate from the other worlds in the Ador-Ayn Star System. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (AE *Ab Egressú* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

### Mankind

The dominant kind on the Ecumene, to which they are indigenous. Intelligent, organized, and adaptable, Mankind has spread to every continent and almost every biome, though they struggle in marginal environments. In their distant past, civilization had been taught to Mankind by the Elves, but the lives of Men are short and the knowledge of Men is easily forgotten. The earliest beneficiaries of civilization used it to create chieftainships, kingdoms, and empires to honor their own power, conquering first their hunter-gatherer cousins then one another. The history of Mankind is a history of blood, primarily driven by three motives: fear, honor, and self-interest.

Some rare examples of Man have been able to manifest arcane power. This is due to an ancient infusion of Elven ancestry that has long been diluted beyond recognition, but has recombined through a chance pairing to produce someone capable of activating that latent power.

### Halflingkind

An offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, rosy-pink skin, and talent for stealth. They live primarily among Mankind, seeking to create safe places within their cousin's world, though on the edges of civilization, there are Halfling communities that are far more wild and strange (perhaps a vestige of their original society).

At a distance, their short stature and neotenic proportions allow them to be confused for Human children.

### Goblinkind

Supposedly indigenous to the Ecumene for lack of an alternative, Goblins are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.

### Koboldkind

A diminutive reptilian kind that originates from the planet [Nebo](/ecumene/heavens/#merodach--nebo), Kobolds are known for their cautiousness, devotion to authority, and resilience. Their homeworld, being hotter and drier than the Ecumene, has granted Kobolds the ability to thrive in places where Man whithers and stumbles, specifically deserts and underground. Kobolds have a particular talent in burrowing and mining, allowing them to create elaborate subterranean environments.

### Elfkind

Few have seen them, and many speculate whether they still exist, or if they ever had. Elves originate from the Ecumene's sister world, Luhan. There, they had established a magnificent civilization rooted in arcane powers. At their height, had the beginnings of an interplanetary empire, connecting the worlds and enabling offworlders like the Kobolds to settle on the Ecumene. Their great power, however, also led to their downfall; now Luhan is an uninhabitable wasteland, and the few Elves who could escape in time escaped to the Ecumene.

Long-lived but slow to reproduce, what few Elves that remain can be found in the places not already taken up by the other kinds, and use what arcane power remains in their position to hold fast to those places.

## Calendars

Most humans on the Ecumene make use of some form of the Civic Calender, established during the High Imperium. According to the Civic Calendar, the current year is *7130*{: .ae}.

The elves maintain their own calendar, the Dögnsbindi. According to the Elven calendar, the current year is *Tykktið 11238*.

### The Civic Calendar

The Civic Calendar was established by Axius Otho, the first Venerable Autocrator. It was based upon the old Edramorian calendar, which during the last years of the Old Commonwealth had been abused as part of the overall political disorder. Traditionally, it was the purview of the high priesthood to determine the timing of seasons and whether or not to insert intercalary months, an authority which could be corrupted to benefit political factions. Axius Otho's reform removed that authority by enacting a perpetual calendar.

The adoption of the Civic Calendar also coincided with the adoption of a new calendar era, *Ab Egressú* ("Since the Landing"). The process of reforming the old calendar and producing the Civic Calendar relied heavily upon surviving Elven astronomy and chronicles.

#### Days and Quarter-Days

Due to the Ecumene’s distinct astronomical arrangement, the Civic Calendar does not count days but rather quarter-days:
- Forenoon (dawn to zenith)
- Afternoon (zenith to dusk)
- Waxing (nighttime before Luhan reaches maximum brightness)
- Waning (nighttime after Luhan reaches maximum brightness)

Instead of a year of 108/9 days, the Civic Calendar has a year of **432/6 quarter-days**. These quarter-days are organized into 18 months of 24 quarter-days. A full day-night cycle is treated as a sort of week.

#### Months

In the old Edramorian calendar, there were 19 months of 22 or 23 quarter-days each, strictly following the phases of the Elder Sister, the largest of the three moons. An intercalary 20th month was added in order to maintain alignment between the monthly cycle and the beginning of the year, the Southern Spring Equinox. Astronomical observations that indicated whether a month was "hollow" (22 quarter-days) or "full" (23 quarter-days) and whether the year was "common" (19 months) or "long" (20 months) fell under the purview of the priesthood.

Under the Civic Calendar, all months are 24 quarter-days each, and the year is composed of 18 months, each associated with an asterism located on or near the ecliptic. Because of their common nature, the asterisms are often referred to in the local vernacular language.

An intercalary day (4 quarter-days) is inserted between the ninth and tenth months according to a formula. Direct observation, thereafter, has been used to supplement the calendar rather than dictate it, to verify that the formula remains an accurate method for determining intercalations.

#### Years since The Landing

The calendar era of the Civic Calendar marks years since the Elves first landed on the Ecumene and brought civilization to Mankind. According to surviving records, this took place on **Tykktið 4108 Köktyl Pý 4**, approximately halfway between the Southern Spring Equinox and the Southern Summer Solstice. This functions as Year Zero for the Civic Calendar's predominant calendar era, *Ab Egressú* (AE).

#### Indiction

During the High Imperium, the imperial administration maintained a 20-year indiction cycle, used to track the reassessment of taxation rates on land et al. and later extended to include other civil service documentation. After the Late Imperium, the indiction cycle was only retained within the imperial core, and generally only for the imperial bureaucracy.

#### Date Format

Dates in the Civic Calendar are rendered **&lt;Quarter-Day&gt; of &lt;Month's Determinative Asterism&gt; in the year &lt;Year&gt; since the Landing**. For example, the 9th Day of the 9th Month of the Year *6999*{: .ae}:
- (High Imperial) *9 Abundantiae [10a Indictióne] annó 7130 ab Egressú*
- (Low Imperial) *il 9 dell'Abbondanza dell'anno 7130 dall'Egress*
- (Mayencien) *le 9 de l'Abondance en l'an 7130 depuis l'Egrès*

In shortened notation, this can be rendered as *9 ABU 7130*{: .ae}.

### Elven Calendar

The elves maintain their own calendar, the *Dögnsbindi* ("Day Tome"). The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days. Unlike in the Civic Calendar, days in the Dögnsbindi are reckoned according to two intertwines cycles of days, each incrementing together.

According to the Elvish calendar, the current year is ***Tykktið 11238***. 

#### Quarters of the Year

The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the time between solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days.

| Name      | Initiating Event                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Jelnystin | Southward Equinox (start of year) |
| Óðkukva   | Southern Solstice                 |
| Kǿktyl    | Northward Equinox                 |
| Ýnpjøttva | Northern Solstice                 |

These are not words for seasons and thus apply in either hemisphere (their meaning has been lost to time). The Elves maintain separate words when speaking of seasons, which are more specifically cultivated to the local climate.

#### Cycles of Days

Days of the year are reckoned according to two intertwined cycles of days, the *Dögnsnöfn* ("Day Names") and the *Dögnsrím* ("Day Numbers"). As each day progresses, the two cycles increment together, i.e. *1 Lahir* is followed by *2 Kúla*, then *3 Hísr*, and so on. With twelve day names and nine day numbers, this produces thirty-six combinations, ending in *9 Kjömr* before looping back to *1 Lahir*. This cycle is completed three times during the year to produce 108 days. The 109th day, which is sometimes skipped in order to maintain alignment with the yearly cycle of solstices and equinoxes, is called *0* with no associated day name.

The twelve *Dögnsnöfn* do not have recognizable meanings within the Elven language.

| Dögnsnafn |
|-----------|
| Lahir     |
| Kúla      |
| Hísr      |
| Söta      |
| Talö      |
| Jǿrsa     |
| Pý        |
| Isjatta   |
| Hjøkkja   |
| Rúha      |
| Séfn      |
| Kjǿmr     |

The nine *Dögnsrím* are traditionally associated with the nine spiritual points of the body; Elven culture encourages one to meditate upon the associated point during that day, so that upon the completion of the cycle of day numbers, the whole body has been meditated upon.

| Dögnsrím | Point of the Body                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 01       | *Rót* "Base", at the base of the spine                |
| 02       | *Elfr* "River", midway between the base and the navel |
| 03       | *Smuk* "Jewel", behind the navel                      |
| 04       | *Hjarta* "Heart, behind the sternum                   |
| 05       | *Skær* "Clear", behind the throat                     |
| 06       | *Gómr*, "Palate", behind the nose                     |
| 07       | *Heit* "Promise", behind the forehead                 |
| 08       | *Ómandi* "Resounding", in the midst of the brain      |
| 09       | *Baugr* "Umbo", the crown of the head                 |

#### Date Format

Dates in Dögnsbindi are rendered ***Year Quarter Day-Name Day-Number***, e.g. *Tykktið 11238 Jelnystin Lahir 1*, the first day of the current year.

## History

The history of the Ecumene is commonly divided into two periods: the Era of Elves and the Era of Humanity.

The former is a primordial period for the Ecumene, during which the Elves established their own global civilization, then bridged the distance between planets and taught civilization to the peoples of the worlds. Its high period ended in a sudden cataclysm, which forced the survivors to colonize the Ecumene more intensely. In doing so, the Elves further accelerated the civilizing of humanity and paved the road for their own displacement by the realms of mankind.

The latter is the time period in which humanity took control of the tools of civilization and built their own realms; in doing so, they forced the Elves into enclaves where humanity could not establish a foothold. The early period of this era is marked by the rise and fall of warlords and petty kingdoms; the latter is dominated by the rise and eventual decline of the Imperium as well as similar patterns elsewhere on the Ecumene.
