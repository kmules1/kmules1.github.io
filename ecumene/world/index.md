The Ecumene is a habitable world, second in orbit around its star, and the primary world of this setting.

Its surface is predominantly ocean, which takes up eight-ninths of its surface area. Additionally, due the distribution of land, largescale arid and semi-arid biomes are relatively rare. As a result, from space, it looks like a blue marble enveloped by wispy white clouds.

The Ecumene is in a tidally-locked orbit with its twin world, [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-the-great-mother), which is two-thirds the radius and two-fifths the mass. As a result, both worlds have an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. Three moons, the Three Sisters, orbit the Ecumene-Luhan barycenter, which is located one-sixth of the distance between them.

## Geography

Ten major continents, eight minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## Thinking Kinds

The Ecumene is home to several sapient species. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. Other indigenous Thinking Kinds include Halflings and Goblins.

Due to its deep history, it has long become home for additional species that originate from the other worlds in the Ador-Ayn Star System. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (AE *ab Egressu* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

### Mankind

### Elfkind

### Halflingkind

An offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, rosy-pink skin, and talent for stealth.

### Goblinkind

Claim to be indigenous to the Ecumene and are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.

### Koboldkind

Originate from [Nebo](/ecumene/heavens/#merodach--nebo), and are known for their cautiousness, devoted, and resilient.

## Calendars

Most humans on the Ecumene make use of some form of the Civic Calender, established during the High Imperium. According to the Civic Calendar, the current year is ***7130***{: .ae}.

The elves maintain their own calendar, ***the D√∂gnsbindi***. According to the Elven calendar, the current year is ***Tykkti√∞ 11238***.

### The Civic Calendar

The Civic Calendar was established by Axius Otho, the first Venerable Autocrator. It was based upon the old Edramorian calendar, which during the last years of the Old Commonwealth had been abused as part of the overall political disorder. Traditionally the purview of the high priesthood to determine the timing of seasons and whether or not to insert intercalary months, Axius Otho's reform removed that authority by enacting a perpetual calendar. The adoption of the Civic Calendar also coincided with the adoption of a new calendar era, *Ab Egressu* ("Since the Landing").

The process of reforming the old calendar and producing the Civic Calendar relied heavily upon surviving Elven astronomy and chronicles.

#### Days, Quarter-Days, and Months

Due to the Ecumene‚Äôs distinct cosmological arrangement, the Civic Calendar does not count days but rather quarter-days:
- Forenoon (dawn to zenith)
- Afternoon (zenith to dusk)
- Waxing (nighttime before Luhan reaches maximum brightness)
- Waning (nighttime after Luhan reaches maximum brightness)

Instead of a year of 108/9 days, the Civic Calendar has a year of **432/6 quarter-days**. These quarter-days are organized into 18 months of 24 quarter-days.

| Order | Name of Month (High Imperial) | (Low Imperial) | (Mayencien) |

| 10    |                               |                |             |

| 14    |                               |                |             |
| 15    |                               |                |             |
| 16    |                               |                |             |

The names of the months are based upon the old Edramorian calendar, of which there were 19 (consisting of 22 or 23 days), which strictly followed the phases of the Ecumene's moon, the Elder Sister, and which had an intercalary 20th month added in order to keep the beginning of the year aligned with the Southern Spring Equinox. All of this required a priesthood with staff capable of observing and recording the movement of the heavens and to make pronouncements on when a month was "hollow" (22 days) or "full" (23 days), when a year was "common" (19 months) or "long" (20 months), and so on.

	<p>&#9136; 109 : long<br />&#9137; 108 : short</p>
</aside>

Intercalation in the Civic Calendar is handled according to a formula, in the form of a single day (four quarter-days) inserted between the Ninth and Tenth months. Direct observation, then, is used to supplement the calendar rather than dictate it, by verifying an accurate calculation.

#### Years since The Landing

The calendar era of the Civic Calendar marks years since the Elves first landed on the Ecumene and brought civilization to Mankind. According to surviving Elven records, this took place on **Tykkti√∞ 4108 K√∂ktyl P√Ω 4**, approximately halfway between the Southern Spring Equinox and the Southern Summer Solstice. This functions as Year Zero for the Civic Calendar's predominant calendar era, *Ab Egressu* (AE).

#### Indiction

During the height of the empire, the imperial administration maintained a 20-year indiction cycle, used to track the reassessment of taxation rates on land et al. and later extended to include other civil service documentation. Following the Late Imperium Period, the indiction was only retained within the imperial core.

#### Date Format

Dates in the Civic Calendar are rendered **Day Month [Indiction] Year**, e.g. *9 Fenarii [10a Indictione] anno 7130 ab Egressu*. This can be shortened to *9 Fen [10I] 7130*{.ae}. Outside of the Imperium proper, the Indiction is no longer recorded.

### Elven Calendar

The elves maintain their own calendar, the *D√∂gnsbindi* ("Day Tome"). The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days. Unlike in the Civic Calendar, days in the D√∂gnsbindi are reckoned according to two intertwines cycles of days, each incrementing together.

According to the Elvish calendar, the current year is ***Tykkti√∞ 11238***. 

#### Quarters of the Year

The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the time between solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days.

| Name      | Initiating Event                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Jelnystin | Southward Equinox (start of year) |
| √ì√∞kukva   | Southern Solstice                 |
| K«øktyl    | Northward Equinox                 |
| √ùnpj√∏ttva | Northern Solstice                 |

These are not words for seasons and thus apply in either hemisphere (their meaning has been lost to time). The Elves maintain separate words when speaking of seasons, which are more specifically cultivated to the local climate.

#### Cycles of Days

Days of the year are reckoned according to two intertwined cycles of days, the *D√∂gnsn√∂fn* ("Day Names") and the *D√∂gnsr√≠m* ("Day Numbers"). As each day progresses, the two cycles increment together, i.e. *1 Lahir* is followed by *2 K√∫la*, then *3 H√≠sr*, and so on. With twelve day names and nine day numbers, this produces thirty-six combinations, ending in *9 Kj√∂mr* before looping back to *1 Lahir*. This cycle is completed three times during the year to produce 108 days. The 109th day, which is sometimes skipped in order to maintain alignment with the yearly cycle of solstices and equinoxes, is called *0* with no associated day name.

The twelve *D√∂gnsn√∂fn* do not have recognizable meanings within the Elven language.

| D√∂gnsnafn |
|-----------|
| Lahir     |
| K√∫la      |
| H√≠sr      |
| S√∂ta      |
| Tal√∂      |
| J«ørsa     |
| P√Ω        |
| Isjatta   |
| Hj√∏kkja   |
| R√∫ha      |
| S√©fn      |
| Kj«ømr     |

The nine *D√∂gnsr√≠m* are traditionally associated with the nine spiritual points of the body; Elven culture encourages one to meditate upon the associated point during that day, so that upon the completion of the cycle of day numbers, the whole body has been meditated upon.

| D√∂gnsr√≠m | Point of the Body                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 01       | *R√≥t* "Base", at the base of the spine                |
| 02       | *Elfr* "River", midway between the base and the navel |
| 03       | *Smuk* "Jewel", behind the navel                      |
| 04       | *Hjarta* "Heart, behind the sternum                   |
| 05       | *Sk√¶r* "Clear", behind the throat                     |
| 06       | *G√≥mr*, "Palate", behind the nose                     |
| 07       | *Heit* "Promise", behind the forehead                 |
| 08       | *√ìmandi* "Resounding", in the midst of the brain      |
| 09       | *Baugr* "Umbo", the crown of the head                 |

#### Date Format

Dates in D√∂gnsbindi are rendered ***Year Quarter Day-Name Day-Number***, e.g. *Tykkti√∞ 11238 Jelnystin Lahir 1*, the first day of the current year.

## History

The history of the Ecumene is commonly divided into two periods: the Era of Elves and the Era of Humanity.

The former is a primordial period for the Ecumene, during which the Elves established their own global civilization, then bridged the distance between planets and taught civilization to the peoples of the worlds. Its high period ended in a sudden cataclysm, which forced the survivors to colonize the Ecumene more intensely. In doing so, the Elves further accelerated the civilizing of humanity and paved the road for their own displacement by the realms of mankind.

The latter is the time period in which humanity took control of the tools of civilization and built their own realms; in doing so, they forced the Elves into enclaves where humanity could not establish a foothold. The early period of this era is marked by the rise and fall of warlords and petty kingdoms; the latter is dominated by the rise and eventual decline of the Imperium as well as similar patterns elsewhere on the Ecumene.
