Most humans on the Ecumene make use of some form of the Civic Calender, established during the High Imperium. According to the Civic Calendar, the current year is *7130*{: .ae}.

The elves maintain their own calendar, the Dögnsbindi. According to the Elven calendar, the current year is *Tykktið 11238*.

## The Civic Calendar

The Civic Calendar was established by Axius Otho, the first Venerable Autocrator. It was based upon the old Edramorian calendar, which during the last years of the Old Commonwealth had been abused as part of the overall political disorder. Traditionally, it was the purview of the high priesthood to determine the timing of seasons and whether or not to insert intercalary months, an authority which could be corrupted to benefit political factions. Axius Otho's reform removed that authority by enacting a perpetual calendar.

The adoption of the Civic Calendar also coincided with the adoption of a new calendar era, *Ab Egressú* ("Since the Landing"). The process of reforming the old calendar and producing the Civic Calendar relied heavily upon surviving Elven astronomy and chronicles.

### Days and Quarter-Days

Due to the Ecumene’s distinct astronomical arrangement, the Civic Calendar does not count days but rather quarter-days:
- Forenoon (dawn to zenith)
- Afternoon (zenith to dusk)
- Waxing (nighttime before Luhan reaches maximum brightness)
- Waning (nighttime after Luhan reaches maximum brightness)

Instead of a year of 108/9 days, the Civic Calendar has a year of **432/6 quarter-days**. These quarter-days are organized into 18 months of 24 quarter-days. A full day-night cycle is treated as a sort of week.

### Months

In the old Edramorian calendar, there were 19 months of 22 or 23 quarter-days each, strictly following the phases of the Elder Sister, the largest of the three moons. An intercalary 20th month was added in order to maintain alignment between the monthly cycle and the beginning of the year, the Southern Spring Equinox. Astronomical observations that indicated whether a month was "hollow" (22 quarter-days) or "full" (23 quarter-days) and whether the year was "common" (19 months) or "long" (20 months) fell under the purview of the priesthood.

Under the Civic Calendar, all months are 24 quarter-days each, and the year is composed of 18 months, each associated with an asterism located on or near the ecliptic. Because of their common nature, the asterisms are often referred to in the local vernacular language.

An intercalary day (4 quarter-days) is inserted between the ninth and tenth months according to a formula. Direct observation, thereafter, has been used to supplement the calendar rather than dictate it, to verify that the formula remains an accurate method for determining intercalations.

### Years since The Landing

The calendar era of the Civic Calendar marks years since the Elves first landed on the Ecumene and brought civilization to Mankind. According to surviving records, this took place on **Tykktið 4108 Köktyl Pý 4**, approximately halfway between the Southern Spring Equinox and the Southern Summer Solstice. This functions as Year Zero for the Civic Calendar's predominant calendar era, *Ab Egressú* (AE).

### Indiction

During the High Imperium, the imperial administration maintained a 20-year indiction cycle, used to track the reassessment of taxation rates on land et al. and later extended to include other civil service documentation. After the Late Imperium, the indiction cycle was only retained within the imperial core, and generally only for the imperial bureaucracy.

### Date Format

Dates in the Civic Calendar are rendered **&lt;Quarter-Day&gt; of &lt;Month's Determinative Asterism&gt; in the year &lt;Year&gt; since the Landing**. For example, the 9th Day of the 9th Month of the Year *6999*{: .ae}:
- (High Imperial) *9 Abundantiae [10a Indictióne] annó 7130 ab Egressú*
- (Low Imperial) *il 9 dell'Abbondanza dell'anno 7130 dall'Egress*
- (Mayencien) *le 9 de l'Abondance en l'an 7130 depuis l'Egrès*

In shortened notation, this can be rendered as *9 ABU 7130*{: .ae}.

## Elven Calendar

The elves maintain their own calendar, the *Dögnsbindi* ("Day Tome"). The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days. Unlike in the Civic Calendar, days in the Dögnsbindi are reckoned according to two intertwines cycles of days, each incrementing together.

According to the Elvish calendar, the current year is ***Tykktið 11238***. 

### Quarters of the Year

The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the time between solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days.

| Name      | Initiating Event                  |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| Jelnystin | Southward Equinox (start of year) |
| Óðkukva   | Southern Solstice                 |
| Kǿktyl    | Northward Equinox                 |
| Ýnpjøttva | Northern Solstice                 |

These are not words for seasons and thus apply in either hemisphere (their meaning has been lost to time). The Elves maintain separate words when speaking of seasons, which are more specifically cultivated to the local climate.

### Cycles of Days

Days of the year are reckoned according to two intertwined cycles of days, the *Dögnsnöfn* ("Day Names") and the *Dögnsrím* ("Day Numbers"). As each day progresses, the two cycles increment together, i.e. *1 Lahir* is followed by *2 Kúla*, then *3 Hísr*, and so on. With twelve day names and nine day numbers, this produces thirty-six combinations, ending in *9 Kjömr* before looping back to *1 Lahir*. This cycle is completed three times during the year to produce 108 days. The 109th day, which is sometimes skipped in order to maintain alignment with the yearly cycle of solstices and equinoxes, is called *0* with no associated day name.

The twelve *Dögnsnöfn* do not have recognizable meanings within the Elven language.

| Dögnsnafn |
|-----------|
| Lahir     |
| Kúla      |
| Hísr      |
| Söta      |
| Talö      |
| Jǿrsa     |
| Pý        |
| Isjatta   |
| Hjøkkja   |
| Rúha      |
| Séfn      |
| Kjǿmr     |

The nine *Dögnsrím* are traditionally associated with the nine spiritual points of the body; Elven culture encourages one to meditate upon the associated point during that day, so that upon the completion of the cycle of day numbers, the whole body has been meditated upon.

| Dögnsrím | Point of the Body                                     |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| 01       | *Rót* "Base", at the base of the spine                |
| 02       | *Elfr* "River", midway between the base and the navel |
| 03       | *Smuk* "Jewel", behind the navel                      |
| 04       | *Hjarta* "Heart, behind the sternum                   |
| 05       | *Skær* "Clear", behind the throat                     |
| 06       | *Gómr*, "Palate", behind the nose                     |
| 07       | *Heit* "Promise", behind the forehead                 |
| 08       | *Ómandi* "Resounding", in the midst of the brain      |
| 09       | *Baugr* "Umbo", the crown of the head                 |

### Date Format

Dates in Dögnsbindi are rendered ***Year Quarter Day-Name Day-Number***, e.g. *Tykktið 11238 Jelnystin Lahir 1*, the first day of the current year.
