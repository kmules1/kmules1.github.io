### Unity of Being

### Three Essential Qualities

It is concluded that, emanating from the One are three essences, through which all entities derive their subsidiary existence and through which they receive being from the One, relate to one another through the One, and return to the One. These essences are matter (HI. *hylé*), breath (HI. *pnoé*), and awareness (HI. *noýs*).

Manipulation of the interactions between the three essences beyond the mundane level allows entities to engage in magic. Interactions between awareness and breath result in *occult magic*, between matter and awareness in *arcane magic*, and between breath and matter in *primal magic*.
