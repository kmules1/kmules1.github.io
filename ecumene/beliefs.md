***Ima*** ("Worship") is the prevailing religious tradition of the Greater Imperium, having emerged from the meeting of early Imperial philosophy and a foreign cult introduced midway through the High Imperium. It was introduced into the seat of power with the ascension of the Dascar Dynasty, which enabled its rapid spread and adoption throughout and beyond the Imperium.

## Origins

The ancient religion of the Sweyriet consisted of worship of the *Idwal*, the Most Luminous, the leader of a divine council composed of other luminaries, great and small, each with their own portfolios and personalities. By the time of its introduction into the Imperium, their beliefs and practices had become definitively more monarchical in nature, with the other *dawlin* ("luminous ones") fully subordinated to the will of the Idwal.

This early cult, called *Ima Talidwala*, was introduced into the Imperium through the recruitment of Sweyriet cavaliers to serve as auxiliaries in the imperial army during the later years of the Attarin Dynasty. Within this new context, the Sweyriet auxiliaries formed fraternal organizations within which to continue their traditional religious practices, to which non-Sweyriet soldiers and officers also joined. Thereafter, it was introduced to the merchants and middling officials that made up the High Imperium's middle class, opening it to influence from the High Imperium's diverse philosophical and religious milieu. In the absence of a central authority, many different schools developed within *Ima Talidwala*.

Dascar Thalna, a general who would prevail in the civil war to succeed the Attarins, was an initiate of one particular school, called *Ima Taliva*. Upon his succession to the Imperium, he would become a generous patron, elevating this one school to political prominence. Under his successors and beyond, *Ima Taliva* would grow and mature, integrating into the social fabric of the Greater Imperium and displacing earlier local religious practices and pantheons with a unified religion.

## Core Teachings

Ima presents a monistic, panenetheistic worldview. The universe is the manifestation of the will of a singular generative divine source, the *Iva*, out of whom the universe emanates, within whom the universe dwells. Life emerges from the Iva, flows outwards and flourishes in the form of the myriad kinds of living creatures that inhabit the universe, and dissipates into degeneration and death. The Iva in itself is supreme without qualities, because anything that could be used to describe a quality came from the Iva.

### Unity of Being

### Three Essences of Reality

Emanating from the One are three essences, which together, in varying quantities and complexity of configuration, form the basis for subsidiary reality and all entities of reality. These are continually received by entities from the One, allow entities to relate to one enother through the One, and return from entities to the One.

These essences are matter (HI. *hylé*), breath (HI. *pnoé*), and awareness (HI. *noýs*).

Magic emerges through the willful manipulation of the interactions between the three essences beyond the mundane, granting entities powers to impose their will upon the fabric of reality.

The categorization of these manipulations:
- breath and matter: *primal magic*
- matter and awareness: *arcane magic*
- awareness and breath: *occult magic*
