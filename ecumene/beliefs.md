***Ima***, from the Sweyriet word for "worship", is the prevailing religious tradition of the Greater Imperium, having emerged from the meeting of early Imperial philosophy and a foreign cult introduced midway through the High Imperium. It was introduced into the seat of power with the ascension of the Dascar Dynasty, which enabled its rapid spread and adoption throughout and beyond the Imperium.

## Origins

The ancient religion of the Sweyriet consisted of worship of the **Idwal**, the Most Luminous, the leader of a divine council composed of the **Dawlin**, the Luminous Ones, great and small, each with their own portfolios and personalities. Their name for their religion remains **`Ima tal-Idwal**, Worship of the Most Luminous.

Within the early High Imperium, a lack of religious cohesion, beyond state-mandated annual sacrifices to **Tanar** as Protector of the Imperium (in effect, a community-based oath of loyalty to the state), provided a vacuum for the flowering of philosophical schools and syncretic mystery cults. For them, the overarching trend over time was towards interpreting various local gods as reflections of a higher, unitary reality.

### Philosophical Monism

Several philosophical schools were founded throughout the Encircled Sea during the Early Imperium:
- **The Eleatics**: questioned the validity of sense experience, explored logical paradoxes, asserted that true reality was an unchanging eternal unity
- **The Pluralists**: asserted that *Noys* (Awareness) is what sets matter into motion, and that there are different kinds of matter, which combine to create the diversity of things in the Cosmos
- **The Sophists**: refrained from asserting anything about the Cosmos, instead focusing on rhetoric and skepticism
- **The Cynics**: mendicants, asserted that [Thinking Kinds](/ecumene/thinking-kinds) were merely animals who possessed greater awareness but were neither logically nor morally superior, rejected conventional desires (power, glory, wealth) in favor of living shamelessly and simply
- **The Moderatics**: mystical mathematicians, sought out higher knowledge of the Cosmos and universal ethics through the study of number theory and geometry; focus on Oneness and Twoness (or Unity and Otherness)

During the early High Imperium, new philosophical schools attempted to syncretize these and other models:
- **The Stoics**: asserted a materialistic Cosmos, in which all things are Form (the manner in which it is organized) infused with Substance (described as primordial fire); Fate is inescapable but Virtue is a means to escape suffering; the Cosmos itself is a hyperbeing composed of beings, and each being a microcosm
- **The Atomists**: asserted eternal, materialistic Cosmoi composed of unchanging atoms, each Cosmos operating on its own rules and governed by chance rather than divine intervention, taught to trust but scrutinize sense experience, advocated for pleasure as the chief good
- **The Naturalists**: asserted a Cosmic Soul, which infused all living beings with life and soul, that the Cosmos is composed of expanding/giving and contracting/taking forces, and that the former ascends back to the Cosmic Soul while the latter descends into Nothing
- **The Emanationists**: asserted the Absolute, an ultimate divine font from which being flows outward to produce the material world, and taught practices to achieve communion with the Absolute

### Sacra Idwalina

Sweyriet cavaliers, serving as auxiliaries in the imperial army, established brotherhoods within which to continue their traditional religious rites. Including non-Sweyriet soldiers and officers, then bureaucrats and merchants, these brotherhoods made contact with the philosophical and religious milieu of the High Imperium. Some of these brotherhoods morphed into the kinds of sacred mystery schools common to the late Attarin Dynasty.

Dascar Thalna, a general who would prevail in the civil war to succeed the Attarins, was an initiate of one such school, which had latched onto the Sweyriet meditative word, *Iva*, identifying it with the true name of the Idwal. Upon his succession to the Imperium, he would become a generous patron, elevating this one school to political prominence. Under his successors and beyond, *Ima Taliva* would grow and mature, integrating into the social fabric of the Greater Imperium and absorbing or displacing earlier local practices and beliefs within the new universalizing religion.

## Core Teachings

Ima presents a monistic, panenetheistic worldview. The universe is the manifestation of the will of a singular generative divine source, the *Iva*, out of whom the universe emanates, within whom the universe dwells. Life emerges from the Iva, flows outwards and flourishes in the form of the myriad kinds of living creatures that inhabit the universe, and dissipates into degeneration and death. The Iva in itself is supreme without qualities, because anything that could be used to describe a quality came from the Iva.

## Practices

## Mystical and Esoteric Teachings

Mystics within the Ima tradition have sought to delve deeper into the nature of the divine and of the cosmos. Some of their teachings have been embraced widely, others by only a handful of schools, and some have been consigned to history.

### Three Essences of Reality

Emanating from the One are three essences, which together, in varying quantities and complexity of configuration, form the basis for subsidiary reality and all entities of reality. These are continually received by entities from the One, allow entities to relate to one enother through the One, and return from entities to the One.

These essences are matter (HI. *hylé*), breath (HI. *pnoé*), and awareness (HI. *noýs*).

Magic emerges through the willful manipulation of the interactions between the three essences beyond the mundane, granting entities powers to impose their will upon the fabric of reality.

The categorization of these manipulations:
- breath and matter: *primal magic*
- matter and awareness: *arcane magic*
- awareness and breath: *occult magic*
