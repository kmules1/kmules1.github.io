## 'Ima



### Origins

Ima's roots are found southeast of the Encircled Sea, among the Sweyriet; it began to enter mainstream society once the Sweyriet began to be recruited as auxiliaries into the army. Their religious practices, called *'Ima* ("Veneration") or *'Ima tal-Iva* ("Veneration of the Iva"), influenced and was influenced by the religious and philosophical milieu of the Imperium to produce the form it has taken in its present day. With the Autocrators as a consistent benefactor since the late High Imperium, 'Ima has become well-integrated into the social fabric all across the Greater Imperium.

### Core Teachings

#### Unity of Being

#### Three Essences of Reality

Emanating from the One are three essences, which together, in varying quantities and complexity of configuration, form the basis for subsidiary reality and all entities of reality. These are continually received by entities from the One, allow entities to relate to one enother through the One, and return from entities to the One.

These essences are matter (HI. *hylé*), breath (HI. *pnoé*), and awareness (HI. *noýs*).

Magic emerges through the willful manipulation of the interactions between the three essences beyond the mundane, granting entities powers to impose their will upon the fabric of reality.

The categorization of these manipulations:
- breath and matter: *primal magic*
- matter and awareness: *arcane magic*
- awareness and breath: *occult magic*
