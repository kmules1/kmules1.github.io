***Ima***, from the Sweyriet word for "worship", is the prevailing religious tradition of the Greater Imperium, having emerged from the meeting of early Imperial philosophy and a foreign cult introduced midway through the High Imperium. It was introduced into the seat of power with the ascension of the Dascar Dynasty, which enabled its rapid spread and adoption throughout and beyond the Imperium.

## Origins

The ancient religion of the Sweyriet consisted of worship of the **Idwal**, the Most Luminous, the leader of a divine council composed of the **Dawlin**, the Luminous Ones, great and small, each with their own portfolios and personalities. They call their religion **`Ima tal-Idwal**, Worship of the Most Luminous.

Within the early High Imperium, a lack of religious cohesion, beyond state-mandated annual sacrifices to **Tanar** as Protector of the Imperium (in effect, a community-based oath of loyalty to the state), provided a vacuum for the flowering of philosophical schools and syncretic mystery cults. For them, the overarching trend over time was towards interpreting various local gods as reflections of a higher, unified reality.

### Mysteries of the Idwal

In the later years of the Attarin Dynasty, Sweyriet cavaliers were recruited to serve as auxiliaries in the imperial army. Within this new context, they formed fraternal organizations to continue their traditional practices, to which non-Sweyriet soldiers and officers would, in time, be invited to join. Entry into the High Imperium's middle class caused an eruption into several different schools that drew from the surrounding philosophical and religious milieu.

Dascar Thalna, a general who would prevail in the civil war to succeed the Attarins, was an initiate of one school called *Ima Taliva*. Upon his succession to the Imperium, he would become a generous patron, elevating this one school to political prominence. Under his successors and beyond, *Ima Taliva* would grow and mature, integrating into the social fabric of the Greater Imperium and displacing earlier local religious practices and pantheons with a unified religion.

## Core Teachings

Ima presents a monistic, panenetheistic worldview. The universe is the manifestation of the will of a singular generative divine source, the *Iva*, out of whom the universe emanates, within whom the universe dwells. Life emerges from the Iva, flows outwards and flourishes in the form of the myriad kinds of living creatures that inhabit the universe, and dissipates into degeneration and death. The Iva in itself is supreme without qualities, because anything that could be used to describe a quality came from the Iva.

### Unity of Being

### Three Essences of Reality

Emanating from the One are three essences, which together, in varying quantities and complexity of configuration, form the basis for subsidiary reality and all entities of reality. These are continually received by entities from the One, allow entities to relate to one enother through the One, and return from entities to the One.

These essences are matter (HI. *hylé*), breath (HI. *pnoé*), and awareness (HI. *noýs*).

Magic emerges through the willful manipulation of the interactions between the three essences beyond the mundane, granting entities powers to impose their will upon the fabric of reality.

The categorization of these manipulations:
- breath and matter: *primal magic*
- matter and awareness: *arcane magic*
- awareness and breath: *occult magic*
