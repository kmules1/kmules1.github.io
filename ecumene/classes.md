The Ecumene, as a setting, makes available only a subset of playable ancestries in **Pathfinder 2e**. These are *Humans*, *Halflings*, *Kobolds*, *Goblins*, and *Elves*. Other player ancestries may be chosen, but will need an explanation to be developed in order to integrate them into the setting. Additionally, as part of this being a low-magic setting, caster classes and subclasses are limited, both in its probability of appearance and the availability per character ancestry.

In short:
- Arcane Magic can only be accessed by Elven and Kobold ancestry, though Humans have varying degrees of Elven blood that can manifest in the emergence of Arcane power
- Occult and Primal Magic can be accessed by Humans, Halflings, and Goblins
- Divine Magic can be accessed by any ancestry
