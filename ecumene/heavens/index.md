title: Overview
---



The Ecumene is located within a binary star system (Ador and Ayn). Each star has its own planetary system (the Ecumene orbits Ador). Due to eccentricity, stable orbits are limited to within each star's frost line. Well beyond the two stars is an immense cloud of asteroids and cometary material. Gravitational perburbations from the two stars' eccentricity redirect comets into the inner system.

Ador and Ayn have an orbital period of 96.26 Ecumene years and an orbital eccentricity of 0.52. From the perspective of the Ecumene, Ayn is an especially bright wandering star, which grows as the stars approach periastron to become a faint junior sun that contributes as much light as a decent indoor lamp. During periastron, prevailing weather patterns become distorted due to the additional solar radiation received.

The Ecumene is a habitable world, second in orbit around its star, and the primary world of this setting.

Its surface is predominantly ocean, which takes up eight-ninths of its surface area. Additionally, due the distribution of land, largescale arid and semi-arid biomes are relatively rare. As a result, from space, it looks like a blue marble enveloped by wispy white clouds.

The Ecumene is in a tidally-locked orbit with its twin world, the Maranthisa, which is two-thirds the radius and two-fifths the mass. As a result, both worlds have an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. Three moons, the Three Sisters, orbit the Ecumene-Maranthisa barycenter, which is located one-sixth of the distance between them.

### The Maranthisa

The Maranthisa is a formerly habitable world, having undergone a planetary cataclysm (in *2791*{: .ae}) which rendered its surface uninhabitable to all known life. Overall, its surface has a khaki-grey color. Lore indicates that the large dark brown splotches are seas, and that the pockmark craters, each with prominent white ray systems, mark the locations of great cities that were once populated by several millions. It continues to be referred to as the Great Mother among the Elves, and had once been referred to instead variously as *Didyme* or *Toma*, the Twin World; *Luhan*, the Shining One, is sometimes heard as well.

Despite its relatively dull color, its immense size within the Ecumene's sky (on average, an angular diameter of 2.744 degrees, i.e. 5.2 times as wide as Earth's Moon) means that the Maranthisa reflects sufficient light for outdoor activities at night. Due to the two worlds being tidally locked with one another, only one side of the Ecumene benefits from this effect; the far side of the Ecumene instead suffers from a lengthy and complete darkness (broken only when Ador and Ayn are near periastron, when Ayn provides a dim light just bright enough to read). The former is commonly called the *Light Side* and the latter the *Dark Side* due to this phenomenon.

Reports from the few explorers who had attempted a landing on the post-cataclysm Great Mother report that the atmosphere has been burned away leaving a thin and unbreathable air. The soil and sea water is poisonous to both plants and animals. Visitation is extremely difficult, even with a fully-outfitted Crystal Ship, due to the need to avoid contamination. Nothing is left of the great cities, but the remains of minor settlements do exist. Corpses can still be found to this day, putrefied and desiccated but not decomposed despite the millennia of exposure.

The three moons of Ecumene-Maranthisa are in orbital resonance with one another. The largest and closest, called the Elder Sister, is also in orbital resonance with the Ecumene-Maranthisa orbital period, resulting in a complex interaction between the five worlds.

The Elder Sister's orbital period is precisely 5.6 days on the Ecumene, and is used as the basis for the month in most calendars.
