title: The Greater Imperium
---

The Greater Imperium is the sociocultural region of the Ecumene that encompasses the extent of states and peoples that are descendants of or heavily influenced by the High Imperium and the culture, norms, and traditions of the Edramori people. Its position near the suborbital point of [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-the-great-mother), dominance of the Encircled Sea, and its extensive access to the Sea of Tyrsan, the Northern Ocean, and the Sea of Dayan has enabled the expansion of Edramori culture as well as its export outward to much of the remainder of the Ecumene.
