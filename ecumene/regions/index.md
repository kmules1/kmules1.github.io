The Ecumene is a habitable world, second in orbit around its star, and the primary world of this setting.

Its surface is predominantly ocean, which takes up eight-ninths of its surface area. Additionally, due the distribution of land, largescale arid and semi-arid biomes are relatively rare. As a result, from space, it looks like a blue marble enveloped by wispy white clouds.

The Ecumene is in a tidally-locked orbit with its twin world, the Maranthisa, which is two-thirds the radius and two-fifths the mass. As a result, both worlds have an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. Three moons, the Three Sisters, orbit the Ecumene-Maranthisa barycenter, which is located one-sixth of the distance between them.

## Geography

Ten major continents, eight minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## Thinking Kinds

The Ecumene is home to several sapient species. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. Other indigenous Thinking Kinds include Halflings and Goblins.

Due to its deep history, it has long become home for additional species that originate from the other worlds in the Ador-Ayn Star System. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (AE *ab Egressu* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

Types of Thinking Kinds:
* Mankind
* Elfkind
* Halflingkind, who are an offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, pinkish skin, and talent for stealth.
* Goblinkind, who claim to be indigenous to the Ecumene and are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.
* Koboldkind, who originate from [Nebo](#merodac--nebo), and are known for their cautiousness, devoted, and resilient.

## Calendars

Most humans on the Ecumene make use of some form of the Civic Calender, a lunisolar calendar established during the High Imperium. According to the Civic Calendar, the current year is ***7130{: .ae }*** (*ab Egressu*, "Since the Landing", i.e. when the Elves first came to the Ecumene and brought civilization). Other, local calendar eras, commemorating ruling dynasties or other significant founding dates, also exist. The new year is marked at the first sighting of the New Elder Sister after the Spring Equinox. Notably, the Civic Calendar counts the quarter-days rather than the days.

The elves maintain their own calendar, which is a solar calendar. According to the Elvish calendar, the current year is ***TykktiÃ° 11238***; none remember the meaning of the calendar era name. The year is divided into fourths, corresponding to the solstices and equinoxes. Days are counted rather than quarter-days.

### The Civic Calendar

Due to the Ecumeneâ€™s distinct cosmological arrangement, the Civic Calendar does not count days but rather quarter-days:
- Forenoon (dawn to zenith)
- Afternoon (zenith to dusk)
- Waxing (night before the Full Moon)
- Waning (night after the Full Moon)

Instead of a year of 108.65 days, the Civic Calendar has a year of **434.61 quarter-days**. These quarter-days are organized into 19 months of between 22 (called "hollow" months) and 23 (called "full" months) quarter-days, in accordance with the movement of the Ecumeneâ€™s second moon, the Elder Sister. Since the Elder Sisterâ€™s orbital period is precisely 22.4 quarters (due to orbital resonance), month length follows a 5-month cycle, called a Quinary: 2 hollow, 1 full, 1 hollow, 1 full.

This results in a calendar of 425 quarter-days to form a "common year". This is 9.61 quarter-days shorter than the solar year, and so an additional leap month is added regularly to form a 20-month "long year". The leap month is the last month repeated twice, with festivals celebrated on its second iteration. Due to the combination of the Quinary cycle and the Leap Year cycle, there are ten different possible arrangements for a given year. As a result, any given year can be described as a combination of where in the Quinary it begins (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and whether that year is common or long.

#### Indiction

During the height of the empire, the imperial administration maintained a 16-year indiction cycle, used to track the reassessment of taxation rates on land et al. and later extended to include other civil service documentation. Following the Late Imperium Period, the indiction was only retained within the imperial core and eventually dropped during the reforms that began the Post-Imperium Period.

## Regions of the Ecumene

### The Imperium

The Imperium has had a global influence in the Ecumene due to its large area, its position in global sea trade, and its extensive history and staying power throughout the centuries. At its height, it held unmatchable power over three continents (Thrasu, Acaman, and Agelae) and a strong cultural influence in five more (the Two Daiphrons, Idan, Ctesia, Thoan, and Euchenor). By the present day (*7130*{: .ae}), its political ambitions have become more modest, having retreated to its imperial core and western territories. Within that space, dozens of successor states have come into existence, replicating Imperial forms and expanding them to new territories beyond the High Imperium's footprint.

The Imperium serves as the model for a state across nine continents, and elites throughout this outer sphere look to the core of the Imperial sphere for cultural signifiers.

#### Society

#### Philosophy & Traditions

**'Ima** is the majority belief system within the Greater Imperium.

Its roots are found southeast of the Encircled Sea, among the Sweyriet; it began to enter mainstream society once the Sweyriet began to be recruited as auxiliaries into the army. Their religious practices, called *'Ima* ("Veneration") or *'Ima tal-Iva* ("Veneration of the Iva"), influenced and was influenced by the religious and philosophical milieu of the Imperium to produce the form it has taken in its present day. With the Autocrators as a consistent benefactor since the late High Imperium, 'Ima has become well-integrated into the social fabric all across the Greater Imperium.

In spite of this, folk practices persist, either having absorbed some aspects of 'Ima or having reformulated themselves in opposition to it.

### Other Successors to the High Imperium

In the years since the High Imperium, its territorial extent has dramatically shrunk back towards its core territory. The areas lost, however, continued to maintain strong cultural affinity with the Imperium, identifying themselves as co-inheritors of its culture and maintaining a political structure and culture modeled after the Imperium. Some have also sought Imperial favor when coming into conflict with its neighbors, as the current Imperium remains hegemonic within the overall region.

#### The Bay of Axiere

During the High Imperium, the Bay of Axiere, located on the northeast end of the Encircled Sea, was governed as the Mayence Circuit. Since that time, the region has undergone multiple periods of unity and division. The cities in and around the Bay of Axiere compete with one another for control of trade in the eastern Encircled Sea between the Encircled Sea and the Sea of Anienne.

### The Dattanese Kingdoms

The Dattanese Kingdoms cover a large region northwest of the Greater Imperium, centered on the tropical Dattanese Islands and covering a cultural zone that stretches from Shashanka in the southeast to Samatat in the northwest and beyond. Many of the royal families trace their lineage, real or fictive, back to semilegendary Kings of Joidakhoni, and the most powerful rulers compete to claim the kingship of Joidakhoni itself, despite the city having fallen to ruin many centuries ago. Despite the tightly-shared cultural and political package, the Dattanese Kingdoms are linguistically diverse (though they do share a ceremonial language, Dinnam).

The current hegemon among the Dattanese Kingdoms is Borey, King of AÃ±jan, of Joidakhoni, and of the Four Corners.

### The Fourteen of Greenstone

A major polity to the northeast of the Greater Imperium, centered on the continent of Pandion, which they call the Holy Greenstone. Having established an enforced peace between the great houses located therein, the Elves in Pandion see themselves as preservers of what remains of Classical Elven society. Much of the continent not organized into Elven settlements acts as a wildlife preserve, with magical enhancements to deter attempts to settle it by the other Thinking Kinds. Coastal enclaves have, however, been granted; in these port towns, the various Thinking Kinds live amongst one another with some limited self government under the watchful eye of overseers that serve the Fourteen.

East of Pandion stretches an island group dominated by the island of Dawncloud. The Fourteen maintain hegemony over this territory, but do not rule it directly. As a result, it is highly influenced by the culture and practices of the Fourteen, and the Elven houses do hold domains there, but it is much more heavily settled by the other Thinking Kinds. Conflict between the different groups is endemic, and some blame the Fourteen for having a role in this. Despite this, its people are relatively free, as the Fourteen have regularly frozen conflict when it spirals out of control.

## History

The history of the Ecumene is commonly divided into two periods: the Era of Elves and the Era of Humanity.

The former is a primordial period for the Ecumene, during which the Elves established their own global civilization, then bridged the distance between planets and taught civilization to the peoples of the worlds. Its high period ended in a sudden cataclysm, which forced the survivors to colonize the Ecumene more intensely. In doing so, the Elves further accelerated the civilizing of humanity and paved the road for their own displacement by the realms of mankind.

The latter is the time period in which humanity took control of the tools of civilization and built their own realms; in doing so, they forced the Elves into enclaves where humanity could not establish a foothold. The early period of this era is marked by the rise and fall of warlords and petty kingdoms; the latter is dominated by the rise and eventual decline of the Imperium as well as similar patterns elsewhere on the Ecumene.
