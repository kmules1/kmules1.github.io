## The Imperium

The Imperium has had a global influence in the Ecumene due to its large area, its position in global sea trade, and its extensive history and staying power throughout the centuries. At its height, it held unmatchable power over three continents (Thrasu, Acaman, and Agelae) and a strong cultural influence in five more (the Two Daiphrons, Idan, Ctesia, Thoan, and Euchenor). By the present day (*7130*{: .ae}), its political ambitions have become more modest, having retreated to its imperial core and western territories. Within that space, dozens of successor states have come into existence, replicating Imperial forms and expanding them to new territories beyond the High Imperium's footprint.

The Imperium serves as the model for a state across nine continents, and elites throughout this outer sphere look to the core of the Imperial sphere for cultural signifiers.

### Society

### Philosophy & Traditions

**'Ima** is the majority belief system within the Greater Imperium.

Its roots are found southeast of the Encircled Sea, among the Sweyriet; it began to enter mainstream society once the Sweyriet began to be recruited as auxiliaries into the army. Their religious practices, called *'Ima* ("Veneration") or *'Ima tal-Iva* ("Veneration of the Iva"), influenced and was influenced by the religious and philosophical milieu of the Imperium to produce the form it has taken in its present day. With the Autocrators as a consistent benefactor since the late High Imperium, 'Ima has become well-integrated into the social fabric all across the Greater Imperium.

In spite of this, folk practices persist, either having absorbed some aspects of 'Ima or having reformulated themselves in opposition to it.

## Other Successors to the High Imperium

In the years since the High Imperium, its territorial extent has dramatically shrunk back towards its core territory. The areas lost, however, continued to maintain strong cultural affinity with the Imperium, identifying themselves as co-inheritors of its culture and maintaining a political structure and culture modeled after the Imperium. Some have also sought Imperial favor when coming into conflict with its neighbors, as the current Imperium remains hegemonic within the overall region.

### The Bay of Axiere

During the High Imperium, the Bay of Axiere, located on the northeast end of the Encircled Sea, was governed as the Mayence Circuit. Since that time, the region has undergone multiple periods of unity and division. The cities in and around the Bay of Axiere compete with one another for control of trade in the eastern Encircled Sea between the Encircled Sea and the Sea of Anienne.

## The Dattanese Kingdoms

The Dattanese Kingdoms cover a large region northwest of the Greater Imperium, centered on the tropical Dattanese Islands and covering a cultural zone that stretches from Shashanka in the southeast to Samatat in the northwest and beyond. Many of the royal families trace their lineage, real or fictive, back to semilegendary Kings of Joidakhoni, and the most powerful rulers compete to claim the kingship of Joidakhoni itself, despite the city having fallen to ruin many centuries ago. Despite the tightly-shared cultural and political package, the Dattanese Kingdoms are linguistically diverse (though they do share a ceremonial language, Dinnam).

The current hegemon among the Dattanese Kingdoms is Borey, King of AÃ±jan, of Joidakhoni, and of the Four Corners.

## The Fourteen of Greenstone

A major polity to the northeast of the Greater Imperium, centered on the continent of Pandion, which they call the Holy Greenstone. Having established an enforced peace between the great houses located therein, the Elves in Pandion see themselves as preservers of what remains of Classical Elven society. Much of the continent not organized into Elven settlements acts as a wildlife preserve, with magical enhancements to deter attempts to settle it by the other Thinking Kinds. Coastal enclaves have, however, been granted; in these port towns, the various Thinking Kinds live amongst one another with some limited self government under the watchful eye of overseers that serve the Fourteen.

East of Pandion stretches an island group dominated by the island of Dawncloud. The Fourteen maintain hegemony over this territory, but do not rule it directly. As a result, it is highly influenced by the culture and practices of the Fourteen, and the Elven houses do hold domains there, but it is much more heavily settled by the other Thinking Kinds. Conflict between the different groups is endemic, and some blame the Fourteen for having a role in this. Despite this, its people are relatively free, as the Fourteen have regularly frozen conflict when it spirals out of control.
