Inspired by [Dungeon23](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) and its spinoffs (e.g. [Hex23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDZcY_PYvrk), [World23](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/zx7jtp/world23_a_daily_worldbuilding_challenge_for_2023/), etc), the Ecumene is my attempt at creating a campaign setting that may be used in the future in a TTRPG. It isn't intended to comport to any particular regular development schedule, but rather to explore the different fields of worldbuilding in a freeform manner, developing from first principles and developing depth in each field over time.

Key concepts behind designing The Ecumene:
- doppelganger worlds with divergent fates
- duality of light and dark (and interrogating the assumption that it maps to good and evil)
- low fantasy, with casting ability confined to certain ancestries and heritages
- relics of advanced technology from an ancient non-human civilization
