## Introduction

Inspired by [Dungeon23](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) and its spinoffs (e.g. [Hex23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDZcY_PYvrk), [World23](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/zx7jtp/world23_a_daily_worldbuilding_challenge_for_2023/), etc), the Ecumene is my attempt at creating a campaign setting that may be used in the future in a TTRPG. It isn't intended to comport to any particular regular development schedule, but rather to explore the different fields of worldbuilding in a freeform manner, developing from first principles and developing depth in each field over time.

Key concepts behind designing The Ecumene:
- doppelganger worlds with divergent fates
- duality of light and dark (and interrogating the assumption that it maps to good and evil)
- low fantasy, with casting ability confined to certain ancestries and heritages
- relics of advanced technology from an ancient non-human civilization

### Ador & Ayn: Twin Suns

The Ecumene is located within a binary star system. Each star has its own planetary system. Due to eccentricity, stable orbits are limited to within each star's frost line. Well beyond the two stars is an immense cloud of asteroids and cometary material. Gravitational perburbations from the two stars' eccentricity redirect comets into the inner system.

Ador and Ayn have an orbital period of 96.26 Ecumene years and an orbital eccentricity of 0.52. From the perspective of the Ecumene, Ayn is an especially bright wandering star, which grows as the stars approach periastron to become a faint junior sun that contributes as much light as a decent indoor lamp. During periastron, prevailing weather patterns become distorted due to the additional solar radiation received.

### Planets of Ador

#### Iubar: The Radiant World

Iubar is an uninhabitable planet, first in orbit around its star. Its orbital period is approximately â…– that of the Ecumene. Its bright white appearance is the result of its cloud layer, underneath which is a volcanic landscape of dark-grey basalt flats and a choking atmosphere. From the perspective of the Ecumene, Iubar is the morning an evening star, visible during dawn and dusk.

#### Ecumene: The Inhabited World

The Ecumene is a habitable world, second in orbit around its star, and the primary world of this setting. Its surface is predominantly ocean, which takes up over four-fifths of its surface area. Additionally, due the distribution of land, largescale arid and semi-arid biomes are relatively rare. As a result, from space, it looks like a blue marble enveloped by wispy white clouds.

The Ecumene is in a tidally-locked orbit with its twin world, the Maranthisa, which is two-thirds the radius and two-fifths the mass. As a result, both worlds have an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. Three moons orbit the barycenter, which is located one-sixth the distance from the Ecumene to the Maranthisa.

#### Maranthisa: The Withered World

The Maranthisa is a formerly habitable world, having undergone a planetary cataclysm (in *2791*{: .ae}) which rendered its surface uninhabitable to all known life. Overall, its surface has a khaki-grey color. Lore indicates that the large dark brown splotches are seas, and that the pockmark craters, each with prominent white ray systems, mark the locations of great cities that were once populated by several millions. It continues to be referred to as the Great Mother among the Elves, and had once been referred to as *Didyme*, the Twin World.

Despite its relatively dull color, its immense size within the Ecumene's sky (on average, an angular diameter of 2.744 degrees, i.e. 5.2 times as wide as Earth's Moon) means that the Maranthisa reflects sufficient light for outdoor activities at night. Due to the two worlds being tidally locked with one another, only one side of the Ecumene benefits from this effect; the far side of the Ecumene instead suffers from a lengthy and complete darkness (broken only when Ador and Ayn are near periastron, when Ayn provides a dim light just bright enough to read). The former is commonly called the *Light Side* and the latter the *Dark Side* due to this phenomenon.

Reports from the few explorers who had attempted a landing on the post-cataclysm Great Mother report that the atmosphere has been burned away leaving a thin and unbreathable air. The soil and sea water is poisonous to both plants and animals. Visitation is extremely difficult, even with a fully-outfitted Crystal Ship, due to the need to avoid contamination. Nothing is left of the great cities, but the remains of minor settlements do exist. Corpses can still be found to this day, putrefied and desiccated but not decomposed despite the millennia of exposure.

#### The Three Sisters

The three moons of Ecumene-Maranthisa are in orbital resonance with one another. The largest and closest, called the Elder Sister, is also in orbital resonance with the Ecumene-Maranthisa orbital period, resulting in a complex interaction between the five worlds.

| Relationship   | Resonance |
|----------------|-----------|
| Great-Elder    | 5:28      |
| Elder-Middle   | 9:11      |
| Elder-Younger  | 6:11      |
| Middle-Younger | 2:3       |

The Elder Sister's orbital period is precisely 5.6 days on the Ecumene, and is used as the basis for the month in most calendars.

#### Acusa: The Reluctant World

The outermost planet orbiting Ador is an unremarkable, uninhabitable, geologically inert body with minimal atmosphere and an ashen-grey surface. Pock-marked with craters that stretch into primordial times, its name comes from an ancient word for the reluctant one, on the basis that it orbits much more slowly than the Ecumene.

## The Ecumene

The Ecumene is the homeworld for Humans (its dominant species), Halflings, and Goblins. Due to its deep history, it has long become home for additional species that originate from the other worlds in the Ador-Ayn Star System, such as Elves, Kobolds, etc. It is the primary world for this setting. 

### Geography of the Ecumene

The Ecumene is smaller than Earth (0.766 Earth Radii, 0.471 Earth Masses), has a large ice cap on each pole, and more of its surface is covered with water than Earth (22/25 vs 18/25). This contributes to there being much less of either arid/semi-arid or taiga/tundra zones.

Six major continents, four minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## Peoples & Politics

### Thinking Kinds

The Ecumene is home to several sapient species, referred to as the Thinking Kinds. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (AE *ab Egressu* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

Other notable kinds are:
* Halflingkind, who are an offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, pinkish skin, and talent for stealth.
* Goblinkind, who claim to be indigenous to the Ecumene and are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.
* Koboldkind, who originate from Ninurta, and are known for their cautiousness, devoted, and resilient.

### Major Polities

One of the most important polities within human history is that of the Imperium, a state which, at its high point, dominated two continents and whose cultural influence reached five continents. In the current year of *7130*{: .ae}, the Imperium itself is significantly smaller but continues to be a center of cultural, political, and economic influence; areas touched by its influence and/or rule over the centuries continue to be governed in a manner emulating the Imperium.

Other major polities include the Fourteen of Greenstone, an elven confederacy with a consociational mode of government designed mostly to regulate its intense internal divisions, prevent general conflict, and maintain elven authority on the continent in the face of intrusive settlement by other thinking kinds.
