## Introduction

Inspired by [Dungeon23](https://seanmccoy.substack.com/p/dungeon23) and its spinoffs (e.g. [Hex23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDZcY_PYvrk), [World23](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/zx7jtp/world23_a_daily_worldbuilding_challenge_for_2023/), etc), the Ecumene is my attempt at creating a campaign setting that may be used in the future in a TTRPG. It isn't intended to comport to any particular regular development schedule, but rather to explore the different fields of worldbuilding in a freeform manner, developing from first principles and developing depth in each field over time.

Key concepts behind designing The Ecumene:
- doppelganger worlds with divergent fates
- duality of light and dark (and interrogating the assumption that it maps to good and evil)
- low fantasy, with casting ability confined to certain ancestries and heritages
- relics of advanced technology from an ancient non-human civilization

## Cosmology

### Ador & Ayn: Twin Suns

The Ecumene is located within a binary star system, in which both stars have their own inhabited planets. The Ecumene is the sole inhabited world orbiting Ador (though its twin had once been inhabitable)

Ador and Ayn have an orbital period of 96.26 Ecumene years and a moderately eccentric orbit. During close approaches, the planets of each star undergo a period of warming, distorting prevailing weather patterns.

### Ecumene & Maranthisa: Twin Worlds

The Ecumene and the Maranthisa form a double planet system (the Maranthisa is 2/3 the radius and 2/5 the mass of the Ecumene), with three moons orbiting their barycenter. The Ecumene and the Maranthisa are mutually tidally locked, resulting in an unusually long rotational period of 65.784 hours. The Ecumene is currently habitable; the Maranthisa used to be habitable, but a cataclysm rendered it uninhabitable over four thousand three hundred years ago.

Due to being mutually tidally locked, each world has a "light side" and a "dark side", that is, a side which faces the other world and a side which faces away. Because of their relative size and relatively high albedo, night on the light side is more akin a perpetual twilight. The two worlds are close enough that large geographic features are visible with the naked eye.

### The Three Sisters

The Three Sisters are the moons of Ecumene-Maranthisa. The three are locked in orbital resonance with one another and with Ecumene-Maranthisa.

## Geography of the Ecumene

The Ecumene is a wet, inhabitable world similar to Earth. To contrast with Earth, the Ecumene is smaller (0.766 Earth Radii, 0.471 Earth Masses), has more of its surface covered with water (22/25 vs 18/25), and significantly less arid and semi-arid land.

Six major continents, four minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## Peoples & Politics

### Thinking Kinds

The Ecumene is home to several sapient species, referred to as the Thinking Kinds. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (a.e. *ab Egressu* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

Other notable kinds are:
* Halflingkind, who are an offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, pinkish skin, and talent for stealth.
* Goblinkind, who claim to be indigenous to the Ecumene and are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.
* Koboldkind, who originate from Ninurta, and are known for their cautiousness, devoted, and resilient.

### Major Polities

One of the most important polities within human history is that of the Imperium, a state which, at its high point, dominated two continents and whose cultural influence reached five continents. In the current year of 7130 a.e., the Imperium itself is significantly smaller but continues to be a center of cultural, political, and economic influence; areas touched by its influence and/or rule over the centuries continue to be governed in a manner emulating the Imperium.
