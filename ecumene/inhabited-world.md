The Ecumene is a habitable planet, which serves as the primary world for this setting. The home to several intelligent species, referred to as the [Thinking Kinds](/ecumene/thinking-kinds/) (some indigenous, others who migrated thousand years ago), its name is well-earned: ***Å“cÃºmenÃ©*** "that which is inhabited".

In many ways, it resembles a smaller Earth: eight-ninths of its surface is liquid water, much of its land is covered by vegetation, and it is encircled by white vaporous clouds. In other ways, it is very different: it is tidally-locked to a twin world, [Luhan](/ecumene/heavens/#luhan-or-the-great-mother), its day-night cycle lasts 72 hours, and the twin worlds are joined by three small moons, the [Three Sisters](/ecumene/heavens/).

## Geography

Ten major continents, eight minor continents, and countless islands. Most of the Ecumene's dry land is located in the southern hemisphere, with the northern hemisphere dominated by a massive ocean.

## History

The history of the Ecumene is commonly divided into two periods: the Era of Elves and the Era of Humanity.

The former is a primordial period for the Ecumene, during which the Elves established their own global civilization, then bridged the distance between planets and taught civilization to the peoples of the worlds. Its high period ended in a sudden cataclysm, which forced the survivors to colonize the Ecumene more intensely. In doing so, the Elves further accelerated the civilizing of humanity and paved the road for their own displacement by the realms of mankind.

The latter is the time period in which humanity took control of the tools of civilization and built their own realms; in doing so, they forced the Elves into enclaves where humanity could not establish a foothold. The early period of this era is marked by the rise and fall of warlords and petty kingdoms; the latter is dominated by the rise and eventual decline of the Imperium as well as similar patterns elsewhere on the Ecumene.
