The Bay of Axiere is a [post-imperial region](/ecumene/greater-imperium/). Extensively colonized during the High Imperium, the Bay was once a unified state governed centrally from the City of Mayence. During the Late Imperium, Mayence briefly functioned as the capital of the so-called *Imperium in the East*, but central power has since broken down, leaving a region divided into several city-states and choked with endemic warfare.
