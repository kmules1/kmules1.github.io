The Ecumene is home to several sapient species. By far the most populous of these is Mankind, which is indigenous to the Ecumene and has a dominant role in its histories and societies. Other indigenous Thinking Kinds include Halflings and Goblins.

Due to its deep history, it has long become home for additional species that originate from the other worlds in the Ador-Ayn Star System. A significantly less populous but historically critical kind is Elfkind, whose first arrival to the Ecumene marks the beginning of the most common calendar era, (AE *Ab Egress√∫* "since the Landing") and who evacuated to the Ecumene following the Cataclysm of *2791*{: .ae}, when their homeworld became uninhabitable.

## Man

The dominant kind on the Ecumene, to which they are indigenous. Intelligent, organized, and adaptable, Mankind has spread to every continent and almost every biome, though they struggle in marginal environments. In their distant past, civilization had been taught to Mankind by the Elves, but the lives of Men are short and the knowledge of Men is easily forgotten. The earliest beneficiaries of civilization used it to create chieftainships, kingdoms, and empires to honor their own power, conquering first their hunter-gatherer cousins then one another. The history of Mankind is a history of blood, primarily driven by three motives: fear, honor, and self-interest.

Some rare examples of Man have been able to manifest arcane power. This is due to an ancient infusion of Elven ancestry that has long been diluted beyond recognition, but has recombined through a chance pairing to produce someone capable of activating that latent power.

## Halflings

An offshoot of Mankind and are known for their short stature, rosy-pink skin, and talent for stealth. They live primarily among Mankind, seeking to create safe places within their cousin's world, though on the edges of civilization, there are Halfling communities that are far more wild and strange (perhaps a vestige of their original society).

At a distance, their short stature and neotenic proportions allow them to be confused for Human children.

## Goblins

Supposedly indigenous to the Ecumene for lack of an alternative, Goblins are known for their invasiveness, disgusting habits, and talent for trouble.

## Kobolds

A diminutive reptilian kind that originates from the planet [Nebo](/ecumene/heavens/#merodach--nebo), Kobolds are known for their cautiousness, devotion to authority, and resilience. Their homeworld, being hotter and drier than the Ecumene, has granted Kobolds the ability to thrive in places where Man whithers and stumbles, specifically deserts and underground. Kobolds have a particular talent in burrowing and mining, allowing them to create elaborate subterranean environments.

## Elves

Few have seen them, and many speculate whether they still exist, or if they ever had. Elves originate from the Ecumene's sister world, Luhan. There, they had established a magnificent civilization rooted in arcane powers. At their height, had the beginnings of an interplanetary empire, connecting the worlds and enabling offworlders like the Kobolds to settle on the Ecumene. Their great power, however, also led to their downfall; now Luhan is an uninhabitable wasteland, and the few Elves who could escape in time escaped to the Ecumene.

Long-lived but slow to reproduce, what few Elves that remain can be found in the places not already taken up by the other kinds, and use what arcane power remains in their position to hold fast to those places.
